## From All the People of Your Life

The people traveling with you. Sometimes they'll stay for a while and rest their weary heads on your shoulders. Sometimes they'll allow you to do the same on theirs. The path we walk is full of passerbys, but those that stick around for a while form with us a connection, cemmented by the laughs, tears, anger, and love felt along the way. You've only just began, but here's a small field of all the flowers that grew because of the seeds you planted alongside the road together with those you met along the way.
